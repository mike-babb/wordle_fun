By checking past Wordle answers <https://wordsrated.com/tools/
wordsfinder/past-wordle-answers/> and learning the full Wordle
dictionary, each player can increase their chance of a better score on
today’s word <https://wordsrated.com/tools/wordsfinder/todays-wordle-
hints-plus-answer/>.


    How many Wordle words are there?

  * In total, there are 2,309 words that can be potential Wordle
    solutions <https://wordsrated.com/tools/wordsfinder/wordle-solver/>.
  * However, originally the game was released with a dictionary of 2,315
    words
  * After the game’s purchase by The New York Times, 6 words were
    removed due to being either offensive, out of date or using non-US
    spelling.
  * The full Wordle database contains 12,966 words, as players can also
    choose from a dictionary of 10,657 additional words that can be used
    to narrow down the answer.
  * When the game was under development, Palak Shah (the partner of the
    game’s creator) was tasked with making a list of solutions from 5-
    letter words <https://wordsrated.com/tools/wordslists/5-letter-
    words/> within the English language.
  * Some of the lesser-known words within the final list of solutions
    include BORAX, ECLAT, FUGUE, POLYP and SUMAC.
  * The most-common letter in the Wordle dictionary is the letter “E”.
  * If the letter “E” is not present in a word, 45.60% of all guesses
    will not result in the solution.
  * In comparison, the least-common letter in the Wordle dictionary is
    the letter “J”.
  * If the letter “J” is not present in a term, just 1.20% of all
    answers can no longer be the solution.
  * Removing the two most-common letters together, “E” and “A”, takes
    out 69.20% of potential answers <https://wordsrated.com/wordle-
    combinations/>.
  * Furthemore, removing the three most-common letters, “E”, “A” and
    “R”, eliminate 78.90% of possible answers.
  * The two least-common letters, “J” and “Q”, are only present in 2.40%
    of solutions.
  * Also accounting for “X” (the third least-common letter), this
    increases to 4.00% of answers.


    What are the most common letters among Wordle words?

When it comes to the most common letters in 5-letter words, there is a
significant difference between the full list of words and Wordle-
eligible words.

For example, the letter S is the most frequently present letter in 5-
letter words overall, accounting for 10.28% of all letters used in 5-
letter words. If we narrow the list down to 2,309 Wordle words, the
letter S accounts for 5.79% of all letters, 44% less compared to all 5-
letter words.

This is important to know when deciding the best choice of words to
start within the game of Wordle. For this reason, we will analyze letter
frequency for both cases – all 5-letter words and Wordle words.

Knowing what letters appear in most Wordle words can help you create a
strategy for the game, most of all the choice of the first word to play.
We analyzed all 2,309 Wordle words, and these letters are the most
frequent among Wordle solutions:

  * The letter E appears in 1,053 out of 2,309 Wordle words, meaning
    that 45.6% of all words from Wordle’s dictionary contain the letter
    E. Make sure you include E in your first attempt!
  * 906 of Wordle words (39.2%) contain the letter A, the second most
    common letter among solutions. The letter R is the third most common
    letter among Wordle words, featured in 835 (36.2%) of words.
  * After E, A, and R, the most common letters among Wordle words are O
    (672 words, 29.1%) and T (667 words, 28.9%).

The following table shows the frequency of each letter among Wordle words:

    How many Wordle solutions end in the letter “S”?

Those new to the game may attempt to find four-letter words <https://
wordsrated.com/tools/wordslists/4-letter-words/> before making them
plural. However, Wordle’s dictionary doesn’t contain plurals, so the
letter “S” is only present as the last letter for non-plural Wordle
solutions.

In total, 36 Wordle solutions end in the letter “S,” and none of them is
a plural word. 21 of these end with “SS”.


    Recommended Wordle follow-up guesses

After each guess is made, players should consider the words they have
already played in order to determine their optimal next turn.

  * In terms of common letters, after finding an incorrectly placed
    letter “E”, the best follow-up guesses would be LEARN or RENAL.
  * ALERT, ALTER or LATER are the best follow-up guesses after finding
    an unplaced letter “A”.
  * However, AROSE would be the best word to guess after finding an “R”
    without a known location.
  * Looking at rare letters, if the letter “J” is found in a wrong
    position, the best word to follow with would be ENJOY.
  * The best next guesses after finding an incorrectly placed “Q” would
    be EQUAL or QUAKE.
  * For an unplaced “X”, players should look to guess OXIDE on their
    next turn.
